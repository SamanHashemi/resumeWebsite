`For the first 18 years of my life I lived in a small suburb in North County San Diego.
I attended a typical public school feeder system from elementry to high school all
within the same district, which led me to build lifelong bonds with many of my closest friends today.
When high school ended I chose to attend a liberal arts school on the east coast for a semester just to
find out how much I missed California and quickly came running back. From there I attended community
college in San Diego for a year and a half and then transfered to UCLA where I finished my 
undergrad degree two and a half years later. At UCLA I honed my skills for computer science
developed incredible friendships and even oragnized IDEAHacks 2019 & 2020,
the largest hardware hackathon on the West Coast. My journey was not as direct as I had 
envisioned leaving high school but the lessons I learned along the way were truly invaluble.`
