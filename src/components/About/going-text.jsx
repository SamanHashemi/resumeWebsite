`I've always tried to make a number of perfect plans for myself, 
I'm pretty sure in High School I made plans for where my life was going to be 
in five, ten, and fifteen years on a hundred different occasions. 
It wasn't until I dropped out of school on the east coast that I quickly realized: 
life doesn't go the way you think it will, ever. Now, instead of trying to plan 
my life down to the second I try and focus on what it is that I want and what are ways
that I can get there. As of this moment in my life there are a few things I know: 
I want to work in the tech industry and find out what makes a successful company successful, 
I want to gain experience that will not only make me a better engineer 
but futher my understanding of business, and I want to develop things that will 
have a postitive impact in the lives other's, no matter how small.`
