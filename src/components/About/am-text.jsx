`Today, I am working from home at a company in San Diego.
At first the adjustment to at home work was tough, as I know
many of my colleagues would agree, but now I've developed a strong, productive,
and healthy routine I've found ways to enjoy my days and remain exceedingly productive. 
Each morning I start by going on a bike ride and finishing each day with a run.
Instead of taking breaks with a walk or my phone, I've found an overall increase
in my mood when I take a break with something stimulating like an instrument or a workout.
Each day, although similar, feels like a new challenge and I'm finding more of what makes
me motivated and ready to take on any new challenge thrown my way.`
