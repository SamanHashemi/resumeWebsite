`Today, I am in the same position as many of my peers: looking for a job and
trying to find ways to stay efficient and busy during the pandemic. At first, when Covid hit,
I had just graduated, and my schedule was already completely turned on its head. Instead
of my typical, class 10 to 4, followed by the infamous work from 4 til' very very late,
my schedule was now full of netflix, naps, and baking bread. However, it quickly became apparent that this
lifestyle was not sustainable and if I were to keep this up, I would soon just be a blob 
of yeast, flower, and The Office. So after about 2 weeks I started shifting my wake-up time,
developing a routine, and within a few weeks I found myself working for 8+ hours a day on my two projects, 
and I even got to rediscover my long lost hobby of playing music. Now I'm feeling motivated, productive, 
and ready to take on any new challenge thrown my way.`
